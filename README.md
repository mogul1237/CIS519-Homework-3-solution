1 [Neural Networks â€“ 50 points]
In this problem, you will implement both Feed-forward Neural Network and Convolutional
Neural Network(CNN) on the CIFAR-10 image dataset. The goal of this problem is to help
you understand how machine learning algorithms could apply to image classification task.
In doing it you will better understand neural learning architectures (in particular, how the
hyperparameters could affect model performance) and gain some hands-on experience with
the deep learning framework Pytorch.
Dataset:
In this homework, you will only use a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset to train a model
and evaluate it. Overall, you will use 10,000 training images, and 2,000 testing images. Each
image has a size of 32x32x3 in the RGB scale. The detailed dataset description can be found
here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/Ëœkriz/cifar.html
Introduction to Pytorch:
We will use Pytorch, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks nowadays. In this
part, you will need to read and understand our Pytorch tutorial before starting to use it.
After fully understanding the tutorial code, you should be able to implement the simple feedforward networks and convolutional neural networks using Pytorch. A useful suggestion is
to plot the loss versus training epoch to check if the loss decreases during training. You can
use the pytorch tutorial as your reference, and create a new python file to implement the
following tasks.
Default Parameters:
As your default parameters, you should use SGD as the optimizer with learning rate of 0.001
and momentum of 0.9, batch size of 64, and max training iterations of 100 during training.
The loss function is cross-entropy loss.
Experiment 1: Feed-forward Neural Network [10 points]
In this part, you will implement a one-hidden layer neural network, and the architecture
is shown in the table below. The original image size is 32x32x3, so you need to reshape
the input image as a 3072Ã—1 vector and feed into the network. The hidden layer has 1024
neurons followed by sigmoid activation function. The last layer outputs 10 probabilities for
each class. Plot the training accuracy over epoch and report the final test accuracy.

Layer Hyperparameters
Fully Connected1 Output channel = 1024. Followed by Sigmoid
Fully Connected2 Output channel = 10. Followed by Sigmoid
Experiment 2: Convolutional Neural Network [10 points]
The CNN architecture we would like you to use is shown in the table below. Plot the training
accuracy over epoch and report the final test accuracy.
Layer Hyperparameters
Convolution1 Kernel size = (5x5x6), stride = 1, padding = 0. Followed by ReLU
Pool1 MaxPool operation. Kernel size = (2Ã—2)
Convolution2 Kernel size = (5x5x16), stride = 1, padding = 0. Followed by ReLU
Fully Connected1 Output channel = 120. Followed by ReLU
Fully Connected2 Output channel = 84. Followed by ReLU
Fully Connected3 Output channel = 10. Followed by Sigmoid
Experiment 3: Image Preprocessing [10 points]
In this part, you will explore how image pre-processing and data augmentation can play
an important role in the performance of a convolutional neural network. First, instead of
using the raw images, you should normalize images before training. Specifically, do the
following:
For each image, you need to normalize pixel values in each channel by subtracting its
mean and dividing by the standard deviation. (Note that the mean and standard deviation
are calculated from pixel values in all RGB channels, separately for each image.) Once you
normalized the image, train the network. Plot the training accuracy over epoch, and report
the final test accuracy.
Additional Optional Experiments: Data augmentation is also a useful technique used
to improve the classification accuracy during training. Common data augmentation includes:
randomly flip horizontally and vertically, randomly cropped, and so on. You are encouraged
to check the Pytorch tutorial. (https://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/
transforms.html)
Experiment 4: Hyper-parameterization [10 points]
Hyper-parameter tuning is a very important procedure when training a neural network.
In this part, you will change different hyper-parameters with some suggested values, such as
1. batch size [64, 128, 256],
2. learning rate [0.005, 0.003, 0.001],
3. convolutional kernel size [3Ã—3, 5Ã—5, 7Ã—7],
2
4. number of neurons in the fully connected layers [your choices], and
5. number of fully connected layers [your choices].
Note that you do not need to try out all possible parameter combinations. However, you
are expected to find a better hyperparameter setting than the default setting. You can also
change the max training iterations to be as large as you want in order to improve the model
accuracy. Report the best test accuracy and the best hyperparameter settings.
Additional Optional Experiments: You can also try different activation functions
and different optimizations, such as Adagrad, SGD and Adam. You are also encouraged to
try more advanced CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet.
What to Report: [10 points]
1. Plots of training accuracy over epoch and test accuracy in each of the four experiments.
2. If your implementation is correct, you should be able to see some improvement of model
performance from experiment 1 to experiment 4. Briefly, explain the reasons for such improvements at each stage.
2 [Boosting â€“ 25 points]
Consider the following examples (x, y) âˆˆ R

(i is the example index):
i x y Label
1 0 8 âˆ’
2 1 4 âˆ’
3 3 7 +

5 -1 13 âˆ’
6 9 11 âˆ’
7 12 7 +
8 -7 -1 âˆ’
9 -3 12 +
10 5 9 +
In this problem, you will use Boosting to learn a hidden Boolean function from this set
of examples. We will use two rounds of AdaBoost to learn a hypothesis for this data set. In
each round, AdaBoost chooses a weak learner that minimizes the error . As weak learners,
use hypotheses of the form (a) f1 â‰¡ [x > Î¸x] or (b) f2 â‰¡ [y > Î¸y], for some integers Î¸x, Î¸y
(either one of the two forms, not a disjunction of the two). There should be no need to try
many values of Î¸x, Î¸y; appropriate values should be clear from the data.
1. [7 points] Start the first round with a uniform distribution D0. Place the value for
D0 for each example in the third column of Table 1. Write the new representation of
the data in terms of the rules of thumb, f1 and f2, in the fourth and fifth columns of
Table 1.

2. [6 points] Find the hypothesis given by the weak learner that minimizes the error
 for that distribution. Place this hypothesis as the heading to the sixth column of
Table 1, and give its prediction for each example in that column.
3. [7 points] Now compute D1 for each example, find the new best weak learners f1 and
f2, and select hypothesis that minimizes error on this distribution, placing these values
and predictions in the seventh to tenth columns of Table 1.
4. [5 points] Write down the final hypothesis produced by AdaBoost.
What to submit: Fill out Table 1 as explained, show computation of Î± and D1(i), and
give the final hypothesis, Hfinal.
